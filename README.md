# ASCII Snake Game

Snake game that is played in the console using ASCII characters. This is one of my first C++ projects. It implements a Snake class to play a snake game on the terminal. Due to the <conio.h> library not being available on UNIX machines, I used code found on a forum to use keyboard inputs without pausing the program. There is also ASCII art used to make it more visually appealing.

# What is compile.cpp?

This is just a simple program written to help make compiling a little bit easier and faster. It uses the system command in c++ to compile program given its name.

# How to play the Snake game?

Currently, this progam is only supported on Mac machines as far as I know. 

*NOTE: make sure you have made your terminal big enough to display the game*

## Steps to run the game
1. Clone this repo into a folder of your choice
2. In the terminal, cd into the cloned repo
3. Run the command, `g++ snake.cpp -o snake`
4. Run the command `./snake`
